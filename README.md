For MLB

To get tags:
$ git ls-remote --tags origin

To exercise code:
1. Import maven project to IDE
2. From ~/marlon-santa/src/test/java, right-click test > run

Notes:
-I'm working at least 60 hours per week and just didn't have the time to do this properly given the timeline allotted.
-The functionality that phase 2 and 3 tests verify aren't working reliably. I will need at least another week or 2 to get this working properly.
